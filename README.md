## ⚡️ Notes for Future Development

- Cart logic is fully modular and easily extendable (currently basic localStorage).
- No backend — all data is client-side (products are manually added inside HTML).
- Hero slider is a manual fade effect — no third-party libraries.
- React, Vue, or backend integration is easy due to clean structure.
- Dev Menu (`DEV` button) allows toggling Dark Mode, clearing localStorage, and jumping to sections.
- Light/Dark logos automatically swap depending on Dark Mode setting.

---

## 🛠️ Potential Future Improvements

- Connect to a real payment system (like Stripe Checkout).
- Fetch products dynamically from a JSON API instead of hardcoding.
- Improve Cart UI and allow a full checkout flow.
- Add form validation to the Contact Form.
- Animate the Hero Section and Product Grid (GSAP or Framer Motion).
- Full conversion to a React.js or Next.js app.
- Add a `products.json` file and a dynamic `products.html` page.

## 📖 Special Reminder

This project was carefully structured and styled by your future self  
to be easy to work on, scale, and improve.
